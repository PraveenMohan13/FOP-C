In Westeros, the fighting ground is rectangular in shape. The King of Westeros, Bran Stark decides to build a fence around the ground. In order to help the construction workers to build a straight fence, he planned to place a thick rope around the ground. He decided to buy a rope of length that exactly fits the boundary. He also wanted to cover the entire ground with a thick carpet during the rainy season. The carpet should also be bought in such a way that it exactly covers the entire ground. Being the three-eyed Raven, he was lost in his thoughts and requested your help. Can you please help King Bran by writing a program to find the exact length of the rope and the exact area of the carpet that is required?

Hint: Area of rectangle = length * breadth perimeter of a rectangle = 2* (length + breadth)
