Description

Rohit likes to play with numbers. He started to frame a matrix called uniformity matrix where he will be using either completely odd numbers or completely even numbers but not both. Write a program to check whether he has framed the matrix in the correct order or not.



Input Format

The input consists of (n*n+1) integers.
The first integer corresponds to the number of rows/columns in the matrix.
The remaining integers correspond to the elements in the matrix.
The elements are read in row-wise order, the first row first, then the second row, and so on.


Output Format

Print Yes if it is a uniformity matrix.
Print No if it is not a uniformity matrix.


Sample Input

4 5

5 4



Sample Output
