Description

Jaffer wanted to excel in Math. He was learning about the Kaprekar number from Meena, his Maths teacher. She gave him a few random numbers and asked him to find out whether they are Kaprekar number or not.

(Consider an n-digit number k. Square it and add the right n digits to the left n or n-1 digits. If the resultant sum is k, then k is called a Kaprekar number. For example, 9 is a Kaprekar number since 9^2 = 81 & 8 + 1 = 9, similarly, 297 is a Kaprekar number as 297^2 = 88209 & 88 + 209 = 297 ).

Can you help Jaffer to write a program to find whether the given number is a Kaprekar number or not?
Input Format

Input consists of a single integer.



Output Format

If the output is a Kaprekar number print "Kaprekar Number" else "Not a Kaprekar Number".

int main() {
    int n,temp,ans,r,q,p,fans;
    scanf("%d",&n);
    temp=n*n;
    ans=(floor(log10(temp)+1))/2;
    p=pow(10,ans);
    r=temp%p;
    q=temp/p;
    fans=r+q;
   if(n==fans)
       printf("Kaprekar Number");
    else
        printf("Not a Kaprekar Number");
    return 0;
