Can you help Harini?

  scanf("%d",&n);
  int a[n];
  for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
    scanf("%d",&a[i]);
  int c=1,j=0;
  for(int i=1;i<n;i++)
  {
    for(j=i-1;j>=0;j--)
    {
      if(a[i]==a[j])
        break;
    }
    if(j==-1)
      c++;
  }
   printf("There are %d distinct element in the array.",c);
   return 0;
