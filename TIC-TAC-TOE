Pradeep is designing the input interaction for X-O game (a.k.a TIC-TAC-TOE). The user identifies the positions as 1|2|3 4|5|6| 7|8|9. Since the board is a 2-dimensional layout (3x3), Pradeep uses a 2-dimensional array to store board status and he identifies positions by row, and column as for first-row elements -(0,0),(0,1),(0,2) andfor second-row elements - (1,0),(1,1),(1,2) and for 3rd row elements - (2,0),(2,1),(2,2). Help Pradeep to solve the conversion from user's input (1-9) to (Row, Column) (0-2),(0-2) respectively.

Note - Indexing for rows and columns is 0-based.

Input Format

Only line of input will contain one integer n

Constraints

1 <= n <= 9

Output Format

By using the input, you have to tell the row and column number associated with it.
