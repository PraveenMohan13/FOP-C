The first integer corresponds to n. 

The second integer corresponds to m(rows).



Output Format:

Refer to the sample output for formatting specifications.



Sample Input 1:

5

4



Sample Output 1:

Enter n

Enter m

The multiplication table of 5 is

1*5=5

2*5=10

3*5=15

4*5=20



Explanation:

Multiplication of the 5th table from 1 to 4 is printed.



Sample Input 2:

5

6



Sample Output 2:

Enter n

Enter m

The multiplication table of 5 is

1*5=5

2*5=10

3*5=15

4*5=20

5*5=25

6*5=30



Explanation:

Multiplication of the 5th table from 1 to 6 is printed.
=========================================================================
#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
  int n,m;
  printf("Enter n\n");
  scanf("%d",&n);
  printf("Enter m\n");
  scanf("%d",&m);
  printf("The multiplication table of %d is\n",n);
  int t=n;
  for(int i=1;i<=m;i++)
  {
    printf("%d*%d=%d\n",i,n,t);
    t=t+n;
  }  
}
