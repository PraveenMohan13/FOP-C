Joey Tribbiani wanted to buy a meatball Sandwich and went to the nearby sandwich shop. There was a poster that said if anyone comes up with a program for Trendy Number they can get free Sandwiches for a lifetime as a gift. Can you help Joey to write a program to check whether the given number is a trendy number or not?

A number is said to be a trendy number if it has 3 digits and the middle digit is divisible by 3.

If the given number is a trendy number, then print "Trendy Number". Otherwise, print "Not a Trendy Number". If the given number is not a 3 digit number, then print "Invalid Number"

Sample Input 0

791
Sample Output 0

Trendy Number
Explanation 0

Here, 791 is a three-digit number, as well as the middle digit(9), which is divisible by 3. Hence the output is a "Trendy Number".

Sample Input 1

Here, 275 is a three-digit number, but the middle digit(7), is not divisible by 3. Hence the output is "Not a Trendy Number".
=========================================
int main() {
    int n;
    scanf("%d",&n);
    int c=floor(log10(n))+1;
    int mid=(n%100)/10;
    if(c==3)
    {
        if(mid % 3==0)
        printf("Trendy Number");
    else
        printf("Not a Trendy Number");
    }
    else
        printf("Invalid Number");
    
    return 0;
