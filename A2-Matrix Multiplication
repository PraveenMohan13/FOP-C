Description

Write a program to multiply two matrices of the same dimensions together.



Input Format

The first two integer inputs, m, and n represent the dimensions of both of the matrices that have to be multiplied. Next (m*n) integers represent the elements in the first matrix and followed by another (m*n) integer representing the elements in the second matrix



Output Format

The output consists of (m*n) integers representing the values of the matrix that is the product of both the input matrices.
